**This project serves mainly as my Github Actions CI/CD hello world project!**

# About
Powershell script `duplicate_files.ps1` compares (recursively) files in a directory
(by comparing their hashes). If a duplicate file is detected, it is moved
to a directory specified by parameter.

The script and the log file contain non-English strings, because I created it for my relative
who can't speak English.
